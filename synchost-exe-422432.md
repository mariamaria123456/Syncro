SyncHost.exe is a legitimate system process associated with Microsoft Windows, specifically linked to version 10.0.15063.0, and serves as a component of the Windows syncing framework, facilitating the synchronization of user settings and data across devices. Given that it is a Microsoft-published file, it is generally considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware. However, users may occasionally encounter errors related to SyncHost.exe, which can manifest as high CPU usage or issues with the synchronization process itself, potentially leading to performance slowdowns or failure to sync data properly. It is advisable to monitor its behavior and ensure that it is located in the correct directory (typically within the System32 folder) to confirm its legitimacy, as malware can sometimes disguise itself using similar filenames. Regular system updates and maintenance can help mitigate errors related to this process, ensuring a smoother user experience.
